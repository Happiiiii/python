Goal:
    To write a python script that blocks a list of websites during working hours(8-16)
and unblock those websites after working hours.

Requirement:

    system: Linux
    
    python 2 (or) 3
    
    Modules:
        time
        datetime

    variables:
        root_file_path
        website_list
        redirect

    condition:
        Endless loop (to run python all time)
            condition for working hours
                open file in read & write mode
                    read the file and store it in a variable
                    Iterate the website_list
                        If website in file(content)
                            pass
                        else
                            write the website to the file

            condition for Fun hours
                open the file in read & write mode
                    read each line in the file and store that array in a variable
                        initially the curser is in the end of the content, we have to move the curser point to the begning of the line inorder to read the file from top-bottom
                            iterate each line in file
                                remove website that are blocked
                                    write a file without the websites in the website_list
                    overwriting the existing file to avoid duplication
